# ML-Project_SignLanguagePrediction
 
Sign languages are a set of predefined languages which use visual-manual modality to convey information. We consider the problem of real time Sign Language finger-spelling recognition.
In this paper, we propose a system based on machine learning that will help all these deaf and mute people to make their communications better. In this we have made a date set of more than 3000 images with the images of basic alphabets of English language. Our system will convert the sign language to the normal alphabets using the images and Convolutional Neural Networks. We have used some of the best available classifiers are proposed to recognize Sign Language for better communication for computer-human interface. This system automatically removes noise from the image and converts into normal English language.
